    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stack tortillas in layers of 5 or 6. Cut through each stack to make 8 wedges. Arrange wedges in a single layer on rimmed baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Combine lime juice and oil in a spray bottle or mister; shake until well mixed. Spray the tops of the tortilla wedges until slightly moist.</li>
        <li>Combine cumin, chili powder, and salt in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over the chips.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven. Flip chips, then mist and season again.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven, rotating the pans and switching racks. Bake, checking often to ensure they don't burn, until chips are lightly browned and crisp, 5 to 8 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving. Chips will crisp up more as they cool.</li>
    </ol>
